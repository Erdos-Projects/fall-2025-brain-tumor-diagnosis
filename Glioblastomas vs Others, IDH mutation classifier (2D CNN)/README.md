This folder includes a 2D CNN model. The structure is broken down as follows:

- Preprocessing of the metadata and MRI images
- some EDA needed for the models (sex vs tumor grade, age distribution, IDH mutation, 1p/19q codeletion)
- Glioblastoma vs Others CNN model
- IDH mutation classifier CNN model
